The concept of a building type is first articulated
in the early nineteenth-century writings of
French theoretician Quatremère de Quincy (1755--1849).
The definition of type is closely associated with
imitation as a guiding principle of classicism and,
conversely, opposed to the notion of exemplar model.
It consists in tracing back to an "original principle"
drawn from "the nature of each region, historical notions,
and the monuments themselves found in mature art."
[@quatremere:1825type, p. 544]
Type is in turn reported to the expression of character,
to which there are three levels:
*essential* character pertains to how a work of architecture
respects the universal laws of nature embodied
in the principle of construction;
*incidental* character has to do with the particulars
of each building culture, as it develops with respect
to climate, geography, and society;
the lowest degree of determinacy is attached to
*relative* character, which represents the analogy
between appearance and purpose.
[@quatremere:1788caractere, p. 478]

The Modernist worldview turns this hierarchy on its end.
It does so at first
by declaring that "form follows function,"
therefore raising relative character from last to
first determinant in the design process,
and then by asserting that
"left and right, front and back, and possibly even
above and below" are "equal in value,"
[@vandoesburg:1971plastic]
thereby obviating any observance of essential character.
Finally, the adequacy of building types to
the place and culture they belong to---that is,
incidental character---is superseded both
by the increasingly wide availability of
standardized, industrial building elements,
and, at the opposite end, by the glorification of
the individual architect's uniqueness.

The impact of this reversal in architectural theory
and scholarship is so strong that they become mostly
unable to acknowledge the role of place,
history, and culture in shaping the built environment.
The German geographer, M.R.G. Conzen (1907--2000),
working from the disciplinary perspective of
landscape studies, sets the foundations for
the present-day field of urban morphology,
in which typology plays an important part.
Nevertheless, primacy is given to the plan and,
especially, to the parcel patterns, which are
assumed to preexist and determine building types.
