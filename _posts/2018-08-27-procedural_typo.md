The critical role of place and history
is restored to architectural design
by the Italian morphologists of the postwar period,
most notably Saverio Muratori (1910--1973),
a practitioner and professor at the University of Rome.
He develops the method of *procedural typology*
to provide a contextual tool for rebuilding and infilling
in historic Italian sites.
Procedural typology is heavily influenced by
urban morphology.
It departs from the Conzenian method in considering
three-dimensional architectural form as developed
simultaneously with the parcel patterns that
enable it, as well as in positing
the generation of building types by means of
successive transformations.
Type is defined in procedural typology as
"the historical specification
(spatial and temporal) of typological process,
from elementary frames up to complex derivations."
[@caniggia:2008lettura, p. 63]

The main feature of procedural typology,
as outlined by Muratori's student,
Gianfranco Caniggia (1933--1987),
is the division of the built fabric of a site into
*base building* and *specialized building*.
[@caniggia:1997ragionamenti]
Base building is what concerns us here.
It is understood as the minimal core of what
represents, in a given architectural culture---chiefly
vernacular---, the "concept of a house."
[@caniggia:2008lettura, p. 101]

The base type is thus dependent on all
geographic and social determinants of
that given culture, meaning it also changes
through time.
From the base type, derived building types
are obtained by "diachronic mutations"
consisting, mostly, of duplications
over the horizontal and vertical axes
(Figure 1).
As such, procedural typology is style-agnostic,
that is, slanted towards modernist abstraction.
The method is nonetheless sufficiently robust
that it can support a layer describing
the generative typology of individual
construction elements, details, and ornamental schemes.

One important remark about the base building is that,
unlike specialized building, it is mostly detached
from specific uses or functions.
Though the base type is generally called, and understood
to be, a "house," this definition is by no means
restricted to single-family dwelling.
The base building can range from rural to urban,
comprising single- and multi-family dwellings
or more complex group arrangements.
In its earliest forms it will support use as warehouses
and workshops for rural farmsteads,
and in its mature expressions it can just as easily
contain retail, offices, and small industrial shops.
